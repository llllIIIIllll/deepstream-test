build
```
colon build
```

run
```bash
ros2 run ros2_videostreamer rtsp_node 
```

use this command to detect whether rtsp have been published
```bash
ros2 run intra_process_demo image_view_node ros2 run intra_process_demo image_view_node 
```
It will take a lot of time to show the picture, need to figue out why.
